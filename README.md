I'm a software developer who loves working on both the frontend and backend to bring ideas to life. With experience in VueJS, NodeJS, AdonisJS, Bash scripting, and Golang, I enjoy solving complex problems and building solutions that users love.

I’ve led teams, built new features, and continuously worked to improve the user experience. I’m also passionate about sharing what I learn, whether it’s through writing blogs, making YouTube videos, or creating helpful content for the community.

I’m always looking for new challenges that push me to grow and become better at what I do - whether that’s through learning new technologies or creating scalable, efficient systems that make an impact.
